What to do:


Two alternatives:
- Either we change the compat layer between wolfssl and ossl, by adding some shims
- Or we compile tpm with wolfssl libs, and hope it works
    - For that, Go back to tpm main, undo modifications done for Ossl
        - or we might as well already copy the new tpm repo into here
    - Some errors will appear, and we work them out in a case by case basis
- Lets spend at most one more week doing this
