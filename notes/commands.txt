## TODO
Remember to check all prints Ive added to Litex build, since some of them change stuff (like rom loading)

# Debugging
15h... got to 0xea... stopped
running for 4h10min, currently in 0c-3
4 cores seem to work really well, 8 is apparently almost exactly the same

0x8 in wolfssl in 25min

We need to implement the shims in tpm_to_platform_interface.h AND ONLY THOSE (as far as I can tell)
There are other _plat funcs, but they are for simulation purposes.
Actually... some of the ones in platform_public_interface need to be CONCEPTUALLY implemented
That is, we might need to have StartUp implemented as deasserting the SoC reset for example.
But the function calls themselves dont seem all that necessary?
They also seem to implement vars (like s_isCanceled) that need to be signals in the SoC itself... we might need some HAL here
About this last topic (s_isCanceled and such), ask Copilot to summarize it for me
Finally, we need to wrap the TPM command with a one (?) byte header, so we can also transmit stuff needed for the side-band (i.e. Cancel request, Locality, _TPM_Hash_Start)
That is, if we still want to use UART, which seems like the safer bet. Otherwise, we would have to deal with
how to share a bus between the TPM and the host in Litex (which might be possible, but still), and that would break our
qemu simulation architecture... so best to stick to UART.

- Depending on the TPM specs, we might need two uarts... one for control signals, the other for data
- That would be needed if the specs say that we should be able to stop an operation midway through, for example


Currently, verilator simulation works, but takes a long time (order of 8 hours)
    - We can run just the tpm, no pqc, on my boards
        - kinda useless since we are already gonna try it in netfpga
    - We can run the tpm, using wolfssl, normally on my host machine, and see how long it takes
        - Useful so we can know if the problem is the wolfssl, or the SoC Core, or the simulation
    - Suppose the wolfssl takes a long time in the host machine, then the problem is the tpm-wolf interaction.
        -Then... is it worth figuring that out?
    - Suppose we cant make the fpga design any faster, and it takes a similar time to the simulation (or lets say, more than 5 min)
        - Then we can have the TPM running on a normal host machine, because we proved that we could have a firmware version of it
            - Then we just do calls to the dilithium on the board.
            - And we can also base our design on the existing FutureTPM
So next steps:
    1. Run tpm with wolfssl on host machine
    2. Run SoC on board, time it.
    3. Figure out from there.
